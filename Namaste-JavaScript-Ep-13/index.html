    <h1>Namaste JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      Function Statement / Function Declaration-> The traditional way of writing
      the function ex. function a() { }
    </p>
    <p>
      Function Expression -> Assigning Anonymous function to a variable ex. var
      a = function () {}
    </p>
    <p>
      Differnce between Function Expression and Function Statement is of
      Hoisting , if we called both the function before its creation Function
      Statement will act like any other function in JavaScript but Function
      Expression function will be tretaed as variable as we are assigning
      function to variable
    </p>
    <p>
      Anonymous Function -> A function without any name is a Anonymous Function
      , it doesn't have an identity , if we write a Anonymous Function we will
      get syntax error as Function statement requires name, Anonymous Function
      are used in a place where function are used as values ex. function () {}
    </p>
    <p>
      Named Function Expression -> Assigning a Named function to a variable ,
      here the named function is not created in global scope so if we will try
      to access it outside the function it will give RefrenceError but inside
      the function it can be accesed
    </p>
    <p>
      First Class Function / First Class Citizen(Function are used as) -> The
      ability to use function as a value is first class function , ex. Function
      can be passed as an argument from another function , Function can be
      received as an parameter in another function, a function can return
      another function
