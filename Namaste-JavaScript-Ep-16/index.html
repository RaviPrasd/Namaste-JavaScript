    <h1>Namaste JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      How JavaScript Engine Works : Code -> Parsing -> Compilation -> Execution
      a.first the code is broken into tokens b.Syntax Parser : It's job is to
      take the code and convert it into Abstract Syntax Tree c.After AST is
      generated it is passed onto the compilation phase
    </p>
    <p>Interpreter : It takes the code and execute it line by line</p>
    <p>
      Compiler : It compiles the whole code first and forms the new code which
      is optimised verson of the code and then execute it
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory Heap : This is a place where all variables and functions are
      assigned memory
    </p>
    <p>Garbage Collector : It is used to free up the space in memory heap</p>
