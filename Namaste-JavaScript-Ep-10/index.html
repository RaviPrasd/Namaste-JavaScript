    <p>
      Closure -> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together
      (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical
      environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer
      function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are
      created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

      Function when they are returned from another function they still maintain
      there lexical scope (remember where they were actually present)
