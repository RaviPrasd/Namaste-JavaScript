    <h1>Namaste JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      A Block is alson known as compound statement , when JavaScript expects a
      single statemnet but you give group of statement inside `{}`
    </p>
    <p>
      What all variables and function we can acces inside the block is know as
      block scope
    </p>
    <p>
      let and const are in block scope , var is not in block scope it is in
      global scope
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadowing -> When we declare two "var" one inside a block and another
      inside the global scope(before the block) so the value of var inside the
      block will overwrite the value in global scope
    </p>
    <p>
      Illegal Shadowing -> you cannot shadow a let variable in script space with
      a var in the block scope this is known as block scope
    </p>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
