      Event loop -> Event loop acts like a gate keeper which is always checking
      whether soething is there in Call Back Queue or Microtask Queue , and when
      the call stack is empty it push the call back in call stack
    </p>
    <p>
      Call Back Queue -> Callback functions that need to be asynchronously
      executed, are pushed onto the callback queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microtask Queue -> It has more priority than call queue , All the callback
      function which comes through promises as well as mutation observer
    </p>
    <p>
      Starvation of function -> When a microtask generate another microtask
      inside the micro task queue and due to which the callback function in
      callback queue doesn't get chance is known as startvation of function
